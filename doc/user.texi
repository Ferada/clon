@c Introduction
@c ====================================================================
@node Introduction, Quick Start, Copying, Top
@chapter Introduction

@clon{} is a library for managing @cmdline{} options in standalone @cl{}
applications. It provides a unified option syntax with both short and
long names, automatic completion of partial names and automatic
retrieval/conversion of option arguments from the @cmdline{}, associated
environment variables, fallback or default values. @clon{} comes with a
set of extensible option types (switches, paths, strings @etc{}).
@clon{} also provides automatic generation and formatting of help
strings, with support for highlighting on @tty{}'s through ISO/IEC 6429
SGR. This formatting is customizable through @emph{themes}.

Depending on the target audience, @clon{} stands for either ``The
@CmdLine{} Option Nuker'' or ``The @cl{} Option Nuker''. @clon{} also
has a recursive acronym: ``@clon{} Likes Options Nuking'', and a reverse
one: ``Never Omit to Link with @clon{}''. Other possible expansions of
the acronym are still being investigated.

This manual is for the @clon{} @emph{user}, that is, the developer of a
@cl{} application who wants to use @clon{} for @cmdline{} option
management@footnote{An application using @clon{} for its @cmdline{}
option management is said to be @emph{clonified}. It is also possible to
say @emph{clonfiscated}. However, we advise against using
@emph{clonistified}. The term @emph{clonificated} is also considered bad
style, and the use of @emph{clonificationated} is strictly prohibited.}.
As opposed to the user of the @emph{library}, the user of an
@emph{application} powered by @clon{} is called an @emph{end-user}.
@clon{} provides both a user manual (this one) and an end-user manual
(@pxenduserref{Top}). Everybody should read the end-user manual first.

@ref{Quick Start} provides a very short example in order to give an
overview of what's coming next. @ref{Using Clon} explains in detail how
to clonify your application, and @ref{Extending Clon} describe how to
extend @clon{} with your own option types.



@c ====================================================================
@c Quick Start
@c ====================================================================
@node Quick Start, Using Clon, Introduction, Top
@chapter Quick Start

In this chapter, we quickly build a very short program to get you
started. We assume that you have properly installed @clon{} for ASDF.
Since several bits are compiler-specific, we also assume that SBCL is
used in this example. If you want to try this program for real, the full
listing is available for cut'n paste in @ref{Quick Start Program}. For a
slightly longer example, have a look at the @t{demo} program provided in
the distribution.

@pkgindex{com.dvlsoft.clon}
Let's put us in the @cl{} user package, and load @clon{} first. @clon{}
lives in a package named @samp{com.dvlsoft.clon}. The @t{demo} program
from the distribution shows how to create a nickname if you find this
too long, or if you don't want to @t{use-package} it.

@cartouche
@verbatim
(in-package :cl-user)

(require :asdf)
(asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op :com.dvlsoft.clon)
(use-package :com.dvlsoft.clon)
@end verbatim
@end cartouche

@cindex Synopsis
@findex defsynopsis
@cindex Postfix
@cindex Text, in synopsis
@cindex Options, in synopsis
@cindex Groups, in synopsis
@cindex Help String
The next thing you want to do is to create a set of options, groups or
texts that your application will recognize and/or display in its help
string. The structure of your @cmdline{} is known to @clon{} as the
@dfn{synopsis}. In order to create it, use the macro @code{defsynopsis}.

@foindex{defsynopsis,:postfix}
@fiindex{defsynopsis,text}
@fiindex{defsynopsis,options}
@fiindex{defsynopsis,group}
@cartouche
@verbatim
(defsynopsis (:postfix "FILES...")
  (text :contents "A very short program.")
  (group (:header "Immediate exit options:")
    (flag :short-name "h" :long-name "help"
      :description "Print this help and exit.")
    (flag :short-name "v" :long-name "version"
	  :description "Print version number and exit.")))
@end verbatim
@end cartouche

Note that the synopsis has a double role: it not only serves to define
the options recognized by your application, but also the order in which
every element appears in the help string. In that particular example, we
define a line of text and a group with a header and two flags.

@cindex Context
@cfindex{make-context}
Now, we are going to define a function @code{main} for our standalone
application. The first thing that we need to do is create a
@dfn{context}. A context is an object that @clon{} uses to store various
things, including some state related to the parsing of the @cmdline{}.
You create a context with the function @code{make-context}.

@cartouche
@verbatim
(defun main ()
  "Entry point for our standalone application."
  (make-context)
@end verbatim
@end cartouche

@cindex Options Retrieval, explicit
@cindex Retrieval, of options, explicit
@findex getopt
@cindex Help String, display
@findex help
At that point, @clon{} is ready to retrieve the options you want from
the @cmdline{}. Let's first see if the user has called the option
@option{-h}, and give him the help string. Option retrieval is done with
the function @code{getopt}, and automatic help string output with the
function @code{help}. Note that what we do here is @emph{not} process
the @cmdline{} in sequence, but look directly for a specific option by
name (this retrieval method is said to be @dfn{explicit}).

@fkindex{getopt,:short-name}
@cartouche
@verbatim
  (when (getopt :short-name "h")
    (help)
    (quit))
@end verbatim
@end cartouche

@cindex Options Retrieval, sequential
@cindex Retrieval, of options, sequential
@findex do-cmdline-options
And now, we are going to retrieve the other options and simply print
them. This time however, we process the @cmdline{} sequentially (so this
retrieval method is said to be @dfn{sequential}). This is done with the
@code{do-cmdline-options} macro. We also close the @code{main} function.

@cartouche
@verbatim
  (do-cmdline-options (option name value)
    (print (list option name value)))
  (terpri)
  (quit))
@end verbatim
@end cartouche

Finally, time to save the Lisp image.

@cartouche
@verbatim
(save-lisp-and-die "test"
  :toplevel #'main :executable t :save-runtime-options t)
@end verbatim
@end cartouche

We're now ready to compile this industrial-scale application and deliver
it to the world:

@verbatim
CC=gcc sbcl --script test.lisp
@end verbatim

and voila!

@chapter Using Clon

Using @clon{} in your application is a two stages process. In phase 1,
you create a @dfn{synopsis}, which is a description of your
application's @cmdline{}m and a @dfn{context}, which describes this
specific execution of the program. In phase 2, you retrieve the options
values and possibly display help strings. Phase 1 is called the
@dfn{initialization phase}, while phase 2 is called the @dfn{runtime
phase}.

@cindex Initialization Phase
@cindex Phase, initialization
@cindex Synopsis
@cindex Help String
Step one of the @clon{} initialization phase consists in defining a
@dfn{synopsis}. A synopsis is essentially a description of your
application's @cmdline{}: it describes what are the available options,
whether your application has a postfix @etc{} The synopsis, however,
plays a second role: it also describes the contents of your
application's help string. When you create a synopsis, you describe the
@cmdline{} and the help string at the same time.

@subsection Synopsis Items
Look again at the synopsis definition provided in @ref{Quick Start}.

@cartouche
@verbatim
(defsynopsis (:postfix "FILES...")
  (text :contents "A very short program.")
  (group (:header "Immediate exit options:")
    (flag :short-name "h" :long-name "help"
	  :description "Print this help and exit.")
    (flag :short-name "v" :long-name "version"
	  :description "Print version number and exit.")))
@end verbatim
@end cartouche

You define a synopsis with the @code{defsynopsis} macro.

@defmac defsynopsis ([OPTIONS@dots{}]) ITEMS@dots{}
Define a new synopsis and return it. @var{OPTIONS} are key/value pairs.
@var{ITEMS} are text, group or option descriptions.

The following @var{OPTIONS} are currently available.
@table @t
@item :postfix
@cindex Postfix
@foindex{defsynopsis,:postfix}@c
@cindex Command-Line Remainder
@cindex Remainder, of command-line
A string which will appear at the end of the synopsis line in the help
string. When you provide a postfix, you also implicitely tell @clon{}
that your application accepts non-option arguments at the end of the
@cmdline{} (this is called the @dfn{remainder} of the @cmdline{}). See
@enduserref{Option Separator} for more information on the behavior of
@clon{} with respect to postfixes. Also, see @ref{Command-Line
Remainder} on how to access the @cmdline{} remainder.

@var{OPTIONS} are key/value pairs. The following @var{OPTIONS} are
currently available.
@table @t
@item :contents
@cindex Text, contents
The actual text string. Try to make proper sentences when adding
arbitrary text. You can use explicit newline characters in your text if
you really want to go next line, but in general, you should not worry
about the formatting because the themes are here to do so. In
particular, don't finish your text with a newline. This would break
potential theme specifications.
@item :hidden
@cindex Hidden Text

texts can still be displayed individually though (@pxref{Help}).
@end table

@node Options, Groups, Text, Synopsis Items
@subsubsection Options
@cindex Options
@cindex Options, in synopsis
@fiindex{defsynopsis,options}
In order to add an option to your help string, you must provide a list
beginning with the option type and followed by key/value pairs
describing the option's properties. For instance, to add a flag with a
short name and a description, you could do this:

@verbatim
(flag :short-name "h" :description "Print this help and exit.")
@end verbatim

Option properties vary depending on the option type. The exact list of
available option types, and the corresponding properties are described
in @ref{Built-In Option Types}.

@node Groups, , Options, Synopsis Items
@subsubsection Groups
@cindex Groups
@cindex Groups, in synopsis

@cindex Text, in groups
@cindex Options, in groups
@cindex Groups, in groups
@var{OPTIONS} are key/value pairs. @var{ITEMS} simply are arbitrary
text, option or sub-group descriptions as we've just seen.

The following @var{OPTIONS} are currently available.
@table @t
@item :header
@cindex Group Header
@cindex Header, in group
@foindex{defgroup,:header}@c
A string which will be displayed above the group's contents in the help

@cindex Hidden Groups
@cindex Groups, hidden
@foindex{defgroup,:hidden}@c
@cindex Help String
@cindex Built-In Groups
@cindex Groups, built-in
@bioindex{help}
When non-@code{nil}, the group won't appear in the help string. Hidden
groups can still be displayed individually though (@pxref{Help}). For
instance, the @clon{} built-in group is hidden in the regular help
string, but the @option{--clon-help} option still displays it
individually.

All option types in @clon{}, including those you define yourself
(@pxref{Extending Clon}), have a set of basic, common properties. Here
is a list of them.

@table @code
@item :short-name
@copindex{:short-name}
The option's short name. A string or @code{nil}.
@item :long-name
@copindex{:long-name}
The option's long name. A string or @code{nil}.
@item :description
@copindex{:description}
The option's descriptive text. A string or @code{nil}. The same
formatting recommendations as for arbitrary text apply (@pxref{Text}).
@item :env-var
@copindex{:env-var}
The option's associated environment variable. A string or @code{nil}.

@cindex Hidden Options
@cindex Options, hidden
@cindex Help String
When non-@code{nil}, the option won't appear in the help string. Hidden
options can still be displayed individually though (@pxref{Help}).
@end table

Note that an option is required to have at least one name (either short
or long). Non-@code{nil} but empty names are also prohibited, and of
course, a short name cannot begin with a dash (otherwise, it would be
mistaken for a long name, but did I really need to mention this?).

share a set of additional properties. Here is a list of them.

@cindex Valued Options, common properties
@cindex Common Valued Option Properties
@cindex Options, valued, common properties
@table @code
@item :argument-name
@cvopindex{:argument-name}
The name of the option's argument, as it appears in the help string. It
defaults to @code{"ARG"}, so that for instance, a @samp{name} option
would appear like this: @samp{--name=ARG}.
@item :argument-type
@cvopindex{:argument-type}
The status of the argument. Possible values are @code{:required} (the
default) and @code{:mandatory} which are synonyms, or @code{:optional}.
@item :fallback-value
@cvopindex{:fallback-value}
@item :default-value
@cvopindex{:default-value}
The option's fallback and default values. Remember that a fallback value
only makes sense when the argument is optional. Besides, also when the
argument is optional, you need to provide at least a fallback or a
default value (or both of course; see @enduserref{Value Sources}).
@item :nullablep
@cvopindex{:nullablep}
Whether the option accepts a null value. Default to @code{nil}. This
property is useful when you define your own option types (@pxref{Value
Check Protocol}).

@cindex Option Types, valued
@cindex Built-In Option Types, valued
@cindex Options, built-in types, valued
@cindex Option Types, built-in, valued
@clon{} currently defines 6 built-in valued option types. These option
types may change the default value for some common properties, and / or
provide additional properties of their own. All of this is described
below.

@table @code
@item stropt
@voindex{Strings,stropt}
@cvopindex{:argument-name}
This option type is for options taking strings as their argument. String
options don't provide any additional properties, but their default
argument name is changed from @code{"ARG"} to @code{"STR"}. When the
option is nullable, the empty string stands for the @code{nil} value.
@item lispobj
@voindex{Lisp Objects,lispobj}
@cvopindex{:argument-name}
@vopindex{Lisp Objects,lispobj,:typespec}
This option type is for options taking any kind of Lisp object as their
argument. @code{lispobj} options change their default argument name from
@code{"ARG"} to @code{"OBJ"}. Also, they provide an additional property
called @code{:typespec} which must be a @cl{} type specifier that the
argument must satisfy. It defaults to @code{t}.
@item enum
@voindex{Enumerations,enum}
@cvopindex{:argument-name}
@vopindex{Enumerations,enum,:enum}
@bioindex{version}
This option type is for options taking values from an enumerated set.
@code{enum} options change their default argument name from @code{"ARG"}
to @code{"TYPE"}. Also, they provide an additional property called
@code{:enum} which must be a list of @cl{} keywords enumerating the
possible values. In fact, the values are not the keywords themselves,
but rather their corresponding symbol name. This means that an end-user
needs not be aware of the underlying implementation, and actually does
not use a colon when providing an argument. The end-user also has the
ability to abbreviate the possible values. When the option is nullable,
the empty string stands for a @code{nil} value. Otherwise, it is
considered as an abbreviation for the first element in the enumerated
set of values. Look at the @code{--clon-version} built-in option for an
example.
@item path
@voindex{Paths,path}
@cvopindex{:argument-name}
@cvopindex{:nullablep}
@vopindex{Paths,path,:type}
This option type is for options taking a colon-separated list of
pathnames as argument. @code{path} options change their default argument
name from @code{"ARG"} to @code{"PATH"} and their default nullable
property from @code{nil} to @code{t}. Also, they provide an additional
property called @code{:type} which specifies the kind of path which is
expected. Possible values are: @code{:file}, @code{:directory},
@code{:file-list}, @code{:directory-list} or @code{nil} (meaning that
anything is allowed). When the option is nullable, the empty string
stands for the @code{nil} value.
@item switch
@voindex{Switches,switch}
@cvopindex{:argument-type}
@cvopindex{:nullablep}
@vopindex{Switches,switch,:argument-style}
This option type is for Boolean options. @code{switch} options change
their default nullable property from @code{nil} to @code{t} (but in
fact, this property is ignored), and their default argument type from
required to optional. Also, instead of using the @code{:argument-name}
property, @code{switch} options provide a property called
@code{:argument-style}. Possible values are @code{:yes/no} (the
default), @code{:on/off}, @code{:true/false}, @code{:yup/nope},
@code{:yeah/nah}. Note that this property determines the argument name
@emph{only}. All possible switch arguments (@pxenduserref{Switches}) are
always availble to all switches.
@item xswitch
@voindex{Extended Switches,xswitch}
@cvopindex{:argument-type}
@cvopindex{:nullablep}
@vopindex{Extended Switches,xswitch,:enum}
@bioindex{highlight}
This option type stands for @dfn{extended} switch. Extended switches
result from the mating of a male switch and a female enumeration, or the
other way around (elementary decency prevents me from describing this
mating process in detail): their possible values are either Boolean or
from an @code{:enum} property as in the case of @code{enum} options.
@code{xswitch} options change their default nullable property from
@code{nil} to @code{t} (but in fact, this property is ignored), and
their default argument type from required to optional.

@subsection Advanced Synopsis Creation
@findex defsynopsis
The fact that @code{defsynopsis} lets you define things in a
@emph{declarative} way has not escaped you. Declarative is nice but
sometimes it gets in the way, so it is time to see how things work under
the hood. Every item in a synopsis is in fact implemented as an object
(an instance of some class), so it turns out that @code{defsynopsis}
simply is a convenience wrapper around the corresponding constructor
functions for all such objects. Instead of using @code{defsynopsis}, you
can then use those constructor functions explicitely.

@menu
* Constructors::        The expansion of defsynopsis
* Advantages::          Yes, but why?
* Group Definition::    The declarative way
@end menu

@node Constructors, Advantages, Advanced Synopsis Creation, Advanced Synopsis Creation
@subsubsection Constructors
Let's have a look at the expansion of @code{defsynopsis} from the quick
start example (@pxref{Quick Start}).

The original code is like this:

@cartouche
@verbatim
(defsynopsis (:postfix "FILES...")
  (text :contents "A very short program.")
  (group (:header "Immediate exit options:")
    (flag :short-name "h" :long-name "help"
	  :description "Print this help and exit.")
    (flag :short-name "v" :long-name "version"
	  :description "Print version number and exit.")))
@end verbatim
@end cartouche

And once the macro is expanded, it will look like this:

@cfindex make-synopsis
@cfindex make-text
@cfindex make-group
@cfindex make-flag
@findex defsynopsis@r{, expansion}
@cartouche
@verbatim
(make-synopsis :postfix "FILES..."
  :item (make-text :contents "A very short program.")
  :item (make-group :header "Immediate exit options:"
          :item (make-flag :short-name "h"
                           :long-name "help"
                           :description "Print this help and exit.")
          :item (make-flag :short-name "v"
                           :long-name "version"
                           :description "Print version number and exit.")))
@end verbatim
@end cartouche

As you can see, every synopsis element has a corresponding
@code{make-@var{SOMETHING}} constructor, and the keywords used here and
there in @code{defsyopsis} are in fact initargs to those constructors.
We now examine those constructors in greater detail.

@cindex Options, creation
@defun make-text [@code{:hidden} BOOL] @code{:contents} STRING
@cfsubindex{make-text}
@cfiaindex{make-text,:contents}
@cfiaindex{make-text,:hidden}

@var{STRING}.
@end defun

Create a new @var{OPTION} object, @var{OPTION} being any built-in option
type (@code{flag}, @code{stropt} @etc{}, see @ref{Built-In Valued
Options}) or user-defined one (@pxref{Extending Clon}). For a list of
available initialization arguments (depending on the option type), see
@ref{Built-In Option Types}.
@end defun

@defun make-group [@code{:header} STRING @code{:hidden} BOOL] @

@cfsubindex{make-group}
@cfiaindex{make-group,:header}
@cfiaindex{make-group,:hidden}
@cfiaindex{make-group,:item}
@cindex Help String
Create a group object, possibly hidden, whose header is @var{STRING}.
Every @var{ITEM} is an arbitrary text object, option object or group
object. The order is important as it determines the display of the help
string.
@end defun

@defun make-synopsis [@code{:postfix} STRING] @
@code{:item} ITEM1 @code{:item} ITEM2@dots{}
@cfsubindex{make-synopsis}
@cfiaindex{make-synopsis,:postfix}
@cfiaindex{make-synopsis,:item}
@cindex Help String
Create a synopsis object whose postfix is @var{STRING}. Every @var{ITEM} is
an arbitrary text object, option object or group object. The order is
important as it determines the display of the help string.
@end defun

@node Advantages, Group Definition, Constructors, Advanced Synopsis Creation
@subsubsection Advantages
@findex defsynopsis
So, why would you want to use constructors directly, instead of using
@code{defsynopsis} declaratively? There are several reasons for doing
so.
@enumerate
@item
Some people prefer to declare (or should I say, create) their arbitrary
texts, options and groups locally, in files, modules or ASDF components
where they belong. In such a case, you need to keep references to the
corresponding objects in order to compute the synopsis in the end.
@item
Since using constructors explicitely allows you to keep references to
the created objects, these objects can be @emph{reused}. For instance,
you can use the same text at different places, you can also use a single
option several times, or even a single group several times so that its
items appear in different places @etc{} Note that @clon{} knows its way
around multiple occurrences of the same object: even if you use the same
option object several times in a synopsis, @clon{} only maintains a
single option definition.
@end enumerate

@node Group Definition, , Advantages, Advanced Synopsis Creation
@subsubsection Group Definition
There is one last point we need to address in order to complete this
section. There might be times when you need to manipulate an explicit
group object, but the object itself can still be created in a
declarative way because you don't need to keep references on its items.
For this, @clon{} provides a macro called @code{defgroup}.

@defmac defgroup (OPTIONS@dots{}) ITEMS@dots{}
@cindex Groups, in synopsis
@fiindex{defsynopsis,group}
@foindex{defgroup,:header}
@foindex{defgroup,:hidden}
Define a new group and return it. This macro behaves exactly like the
@code{group} form in a call to @code{defsynopsis} (@pxref{Groups}). In
fact, an intermediate step in the expansion of the @code{defsynopsis}
macro is to transform @code{group} forms into @code{defgroup} macro
calls.

@cindex Context
Step two of the @clon{} initialization phase consists in creating a
@dfn{context}. A context is an object representing a particular instance
of your program, for example (and most notably) with an actual
@cmdline{} as the user typed it.

@node Making A Context, Context Readers, Context Creation, Context Creation
@subsection Making A Context

@cfindex{make-context}
You create a context with the @code{make-context} function.

@defun make-context
@cfsubindex{make-context}
Create a new context. That's it.
@end defun

@node Context Readers, , Making A Context, Context Creation
@subsection Context Readers

Once a context object is created, you have access to two interesting
slots in it.

* Command-Line Remainder::      The non-options part
@end menu

@node Program Name, Command-Line Remainder, Context Readers, Context Readers
@subsubsection Program Name
The application's program name, as it appears on the @cmdline{}, may be
accessed from @clon{} via the context object. You may find it easier to
do this way, as @clon{} wraps around implementation-dependent access
methods to @code{argv[0]}.

@rfindex{progname}
In order to retrieve @code{argv[0]}, use the @code{progname} reader on
the context object like this: @code{(progname context)}.

@node Command-Line Remainder, , Program Name, Context Readers
@subsubsection Command-Line Remainder
@cindex Remainder, of command-line
@cindex Command-Line Remainder
In the case your @cmdline{} has a remainder (that is, a non-options
part; see @enduserref{Option Separator} and @ref{Synopsis Items}), you
may need to access it in order to process it independently from @clon{}.
Since @clon{} is responsible for parsing the @cmdline{}, it is also in
charge of figuring out where the remainder of the @cmdline{} begins.

@rfindex{remainder}
The @cmdline{} remainder is known to @clon{} as soon as a context is
created. You can retrieve it by using the @code{remainder} reader on the
context object like this: @code{(remainder context)}. The remainder is
provided as a list of strings.

@cindex Runtime Phase

@cindex Retrieval, of options
@cindex Options Retrieval

During the runtime phase of @clon{}, your main activity will be to
retrieve options and their values. @clon{} provides two techniques for
retrieving options: you can request the value for a specific option
directly, or you can process the @cmdline{} sequentially, which is the
more traditional approach.

Both of these techniques can be freely combined together at any time,
because @clon{} keeps track of the current status of the @cmdline{}. In
fact, @clon{} never works on the original @cmdline{}, but uses a mutable
@emph{copy} of it after parsing.

Finally, remember that the @cmdline{} is scanned from left to right
during option retrieval (@pxenduserref{Option Retrieval}).

@menu
* Explicit Retrieval::          Accessing options by name
* Sequential Retrieval::        Accessing options in order
@end menu

@node Explicit Retrieval, Sequential Retrieval, Option Retrieval, Option Retrieval
@subsection Explicit Retrieval
@cindex Options Retrieval, explicit
@cindex Retrieval, of options, explicit
Since @clon{} lets you retrieve options on demand (at any time), it
makes sense to be able to request the value of a specific option
explicitely. For instance, you might want to try the @samp{--help}
option first, without looking at the rest of the @cmdline{} because the
application will in fact quit immediately after having displayed the
help string.

@defun getopt :KEY VALUE@dots{}
Retrieve the value of a specific option. The following @var{:KEY}s are
currently available.

@table @code
@item :short-name
@item :long-name
@fkindex{getopt,:short-name}
@fkindex{getopt,:long-name}
Use one of these 2 keys to specify the name of the option you wish to
retrieve.
@item :option
@fkindex{getopt,:option}
Alternatively, you can use a reference to an option object
(@pxref{Constructors}).
@end table

This function return two values: the option's value and the value's
source (@pxenduserref{Value Sources}).
@end defun

The value's source may have the following forms:
@table @code
@item (:cmdline @var{NAME})
@cindex Values, source, @cmdline{}
This is for options found on the @cmdline{}. @var{NAME} is the name used
on the @cmdline{}. It can be the option's long or short name, or a
completed long name if the option's name was abbreviated. A completed
name displays the omitted parts in parentheses (@code{"he(lp)"} for
instance).
@item (:fallback @var{NAME})
@cvopindex{:fallback-value}
@cindex Values, source, fallback
The same but when the fallback value is used, that is, when an option is
not provided with its (optional) argument.
@item (:default @var{NAME})
@cvopindex{:default-value}
@cindex Values, source, default
The same, but when the default value is used (because there is no
fallback).
@item (:environment @var{VAR})
@copindex{:env-var}
@cindex Values, source, environment
This is for options not found on the @cmdline{} but for which there is
an associated environment variable set in the application's environment.
@var{VAR} is the name of the corresponding environment variable.
@item :default
@cvopindex{:default-value}
@cindex Values, source, default
This is for options not found anywhere, but for which a default value
was provided.
@end table

@oindex{Flags,flag}
@findex getopt
Note that because flags don't take any argument, @code{getopt} returns a
virtual value of @code{t} when they are found or a corresponding
environment variable exists in the environment. For the same reason, a
flag's value source may ony be @code{(:cmdline @var{NAME})} or
@code{(:environment @var{VAR})}.

@cvopindex{:nullablep}
@findex getopt
When an option is not found anywhere and there is no default value,
@code{getopt} just returns nil (no second value). Also, note that when
your option is nullable, you @emph{need} to handle the second retrun
value to make the difference between an option not found, and an actual
value of @code{nil}.


@node Sequential Retrieval, , Explicit Retrieval, Option Retrieval
@subsection Sequential Retrieval
@cindex Options Retrieval, sequential
@cindex Retrieval, of options, sequential
The more traditional approach to option retrieval is to scan the
@cmdline{} for options in their order of appearance. @clon{} supports
this by providing you with one function and two macros, as explained
below.

@defun getopt-cmdline
Get the @dfn{next} @cmdline{} option, that is, the first option on the
@cmdline{} that has not been previously retrieved, either explicitely or
sequentially.

When there are no more options on the @cmdline{}, this function returns
@code{nil}. Otherwise, four values are returned: the corresponding
option object from the synopsis definition (@pxref{Constructors}), the
name used on the @cmdline{}, the option's value and the value source
(@code{:cmdline}, @code{:fallback} or @code{:default}). As in the case
of explicit retrieval (@pxref{Explicit Retrieval}), the option's name
may be completed in case of abbreviation.

@rfindex{short-name}
@rfindex{long-name}
@copindex{:short-name}
@copindex{:long-name}
Unless you keep references to all your option objects (and thus can
compare them directly to the one returned by this function), you can
still identify the retrieved option by using the @code{short-name} and
@code{long-name} readers on it: simply use @code{(long-name
@var{OPTION})} or @code{(short-name @var{OPTION})} and you will get the
corresponding strings.
@end defun

@defmac multiple-value-getopt-cmdline (OPTION NAME VALUE SOURCE) BODY
Evaluate @var{BODY} with @var{OPTION}, @var{NAME}, @var{VALUE} and
@var{SOURCE} bound to the values returned by the @code{getopt-cmdline}
function above. Note that @var{BODY} is not evaluated if there was no
remaining option on the @cmdline{}, so you don't need to conditionalize
on @var{OPTION} being @code{null} yourself.
@end defmac

@defmac do-cmdline-options (OPTION NAME VALUE SOURCE) BODY
As above, but loop over all @cmdline{} options.
@end defmac


@c ----
@c Help
@c ----
@node Help, , Option Retrieval, Using Clon
@section Help
@cindex Help String
One of the first motivations in the design of @clon{} was to automate
the generation of the help string, which is a very boring maintenance
task to do by hand. The application's synopsis contains all the
necessary information to do so. In order to print your application's
help string, use the @code{help} function.

@defun help [@code{:item} ITEM]
@bioindex{search-path}
@evindex{CLON_SEARCH_PATH}
@bioindex{highlight}
@evindex{CLON_HIGHLIGHT}
@bioindex{theme}
@evindex{CLON_THEME}
@bioindex{line-width}
@evindex{CLON_LINE_WIDTH}
Print the application's help string. Printing honors the search path,
theme, line width and highlight settings provided by the corresponding
built-in options (@pxenduserref{Theme Mechanism}).
@end defun

@fkindex{help,:item}
By default, @code{help} prints the whole application help string,
excluding hidden items. However, if you have kept a reference to any
synopsis item (option, text, group), you can pass it as the value of the
@code{:item} key, and @clon{} will only print the help string for that
particular item. In this case however, the hidden state of the item is
discarded (but @emph{not} the ones of sub-items).

@bioindex{help}
@cindex Built-In Groups
@cindex Groups, built-in
@cindex Hidden Groups
@cindex Groups, hidden
For instance, the @clon{} built-in group is normally hidden, so it
doesn't show up in the global help string, but the @option{--clon-help}
option uses the @code{help} function on it explicitely, so it discards
its hidden state.

Here is a potentially useful application of hidden groups in conjunction
with the @code{:item} key. Look at ImageMagick's @file{convert}
program's help string for instance: it is 276 lines long. Gosh. The help
string is decomposed into several categories: image settings, image
operators, misc options @etc{}. If I were to implement this program, I
would rather have the @option{--help} option display an overview of the
program, advertise @option{--version} and a couple of others, and I
would then implement @option{--help} as an enumeration for listing every
option category individually (they would normally be stored in hidden
groups). The user could then use @option{--help=settings},
@option{--help=operators} and so on to display only the category she's
interested in.

Finally, here is potentially useful application of hidden options that
are never ever displayed in any help string whatsoever, and I mean,
like, ever. This is the perfect tool for backdoor'ing a program. For
instance, if you ever need to implement a
@option{--discard-all-security-measures-and-blow-the-nuke} option, then
you'd better have it hidden@dots{}

@chapter Extending Clon

As you know, @clon{} already provides seven built-in option types: flags
and six other types for valued options (@pxref{Built-In Valued
Options}). After using @clon{} for a while, you may find that however
brilliant and perfectly designed it is, none of the provided built-in
types fullfill your requirements exactly. There are two ways around
this: the right way and the wrong way (hint).

@voindex{Strings,stropt}
The wrong, although perhaps quicker way would be to use the
@code{stropt} option type to simply retrieve unprocessed string values,
and then do whatever tweaking required on them. In doing so, you risk
reinventing some of @clon{}'s wheels.

The right way is to define a new option type. Properly defined option
types are a good thing because they allow for reusability and also
extensibility, since new option types can always be defined on top of
others.
@voindex{Enumerations,enum}
In this chapter we explain how to extend @clon{} by providing new option
types. We illustrate the process with the example of the built-in
@code{enum} one.

@cindex Valued Options
@cindex Options, valued
@oindex{Flags,flag}
Oh, and I almost forgot. I hope it is obvious to everyone that new
option types are always @emph{valued}. There's no point in extending
@clon{} with options that don't take any arguments, since we already
have flags.

Creating your own option type involves 4 steps: providing a class for
them, implementing two protocols related to argument/value conversion,
and providing a constructor function. We now review those 4 steps in
order.

@subsection New Option Classes
@clsindex{option}
@clsindex{valued-option}
@clon{} maintains a class hierarchy for all option types. The mother of
all option types is the @code{option} abstract class. It handles the
options'short and long names, description and associated environment
variable (@pxref{Common Properties}). Valued options inherit from an
abstract subclass of @code{option} called @code{valued-option}. This
class handles the option's argument name and status (optional or
mandatory), fallback and default values, and nullable status
(@pxref{Common Valued Option Properties}).

@cindex User-Defined Option Classes
@cindex Option Classes, user-defined
In order to create a new option type, @clon{} provides a convenience
macro named @code{defoption}.

@defmac defoption CLASS SUPERCLASSES SLOTS &rest OPTIONS
Wrapper around @code{defclass} for defining a new valued option type.
Option types created like this implicitely inherit from
@code{valued-option} and in turn @code{option}, so you don't need to put
them explicitely in the @var{SUPERCLASSES} list.
@end defmac

Let's look at the enumeration example now.

@cartouche
@verbatim
(defoption enum (enum-base)
  ((argument-name ;; inherited from the VALUED-OPTION class
    :initform "TYPE"))
  (:documentation "The ENUM class.
This class implements options whose values belong to a set of keywords."))

@voindex{Enumerations,enum}
@vopindex{Enumerations,enum,:enum}
@voindex{Extended Switches,xswitch}
@vopindex{Extended Switches,xswitch,:enum}
@clsindex{enum-base}
As you can see, this class inherits from @code{enum-base}, which is the
class handling the @code{:enum} property. The reason for this split is
that there are currently two option types providing enumeration-like
facility: @code{enum} and @code{xswitch}, so @code{xswitch} also
inherits from @code{enum-base}.

@clsindex{valued-option}
@cvopindex{:argument-name}
There are no new slots in this class, but the @code{argument-name} slot
provided by the @code{valued-option} class has its initform changed from
@code{"ARG"} to @code{"TYPE"}.

@node Value Check Protocol, Conversion Protocol, New Option Classes, New Option Types
@subsection Value Check Protocol
@cindex Value Check Protocol
@cindex Protocols, value check
Now that we have our new option class, we need to implement the
so-called @dfn{value check} protocol. This protocol is used to make sure
that values provided for options of your new type actually comply with
the type in question. Values currently checked are fallback values,
default values, and values provided from a debugger restart
(@pxenduserref{Error Management}).

The value check protocol is implemented through a @code{check} generic
function for which you must provide a method.

@deffn {Generic Function} check OPTION VALUE
@gfsubindex{check}
@ecindex invalid-value
Check that @var{VALUE} is valid for @var{OPTION}. If @var{VALUE} is
valid, return it. Otherwise, raise an @code{invalid-value} error.
@end deffn

As you can see, you need to provide a method with the first argument
specialized to your new option type. This method must return @var{VALUE}
if it is okay, and raise an @code{invalid-value} error otherwise.

@gfmindex{check,:around}
This protocol additionally has the following @code{:around} method:

@cartouche
@verbatim
(defgeneric check (valued-option value)
  (:method :around ((option valued-option) value)
    "Bypass the provided user method if VALUE is nil and OPTION is nullable."
    ;; #### NOTE: check must return the value if it is valid. This is
    ;; exactly what happens below when the unless clause fails (it returns
    ;; nil).
    (unless (and (nullablep option) (null value))
      (call-next-method))))
@end verbatim
@end cartouche

@cvopindex{:nullablep}
This means that if your option is nullable (@pxref{Common Valued Option
Properties}) and the provided value is @code{nil}, your method will
actually be bypassed. Nullable options turn out to be very common, so
this simplifies the writing of @code{check} methods.

@ecindex invalid-value
@clon{} maintains a hierarchy of error conditions. The
@code{invalid-value} error condition is defined like this:

@cartouche
@verbatim
(define-condition invalid-value (option-error)
  ((value :documentation "The invalid value."
	  :initarg :value
	  :reader value)
   (comment :documentation "An additional comment about the error."
	    :type string
	    :initarg :comment
	    :reader comment))
  (:report (lambda (error stream)
	     (format stream "Option ~A: invalid value ~S.~@[~%~A~]"
	       (option error) (value error) (comment error))))
  (:documentation "An invalid value error."))
@end verbatim
@end cartouche

@ecindex invalid-value
@ecsindex{invalid-value,value}
@ecsindex{invalid-value,comment}
When the error is raised, you must fill in the @code{value} and
@code{comment} slots appropriately.
@ecindex option-error
@ecsindex{option-error,option}
The super-condition @code{option-error} provides an additional
@code{option} slot that you must also fill in when the error is raised.

@gfmindex{check,@r{Enumerations (}enum@r{)}}
Let's look at the enumeration example now.

@cartouche
@verbatim
(defmethod check ((enum enum) value)
  "Check that VALUE is a valid ENUM."
  (unless (keywordp value)
    (error 'invalid-value
	   :option enum
	   :value value
	   :comment "Value must be a keyword."))
  (unless (member value (enum enum))
    (error 'invalid-value
	   :option enum
	   :value value
	   :comment (format nil "Valid values are: ~A."
		      (symbols-to-string (enum enum)))))
  value)
@end verbatim
@end cartouche

@voindex{Enumerations,enum}
@cvopindex{:nullablep}
This code should be self-explanatory. We first check that we got a
keyword, and then that it belongs the the enumeration. Also, note that
the nullable case is not treated explicitely. If the option was nullable
and @code{nil} was provided, this method is not called at all. If
@var{VALUE} is non-@var{nil}, then it goes through this method as any
other value, and if @code{nil} was provided for a non-nullable option,
the checks above will fail all the same.


@node Conversion Protocol, Constructor Functions, Value Check Protocol, New Option Types
@subsection Conversion Protocol
@cindex Conversion Protocol
@cindex Protocols, conversion
The next protocol we need to implement is the so-called @dfn{conversion}
protocol. This protocol is used to convert option arguments (that is,
strings) to an actual value of the proper type. Arguments currently
converted may come the @cmdline{}, the value of an environment variable,
and arguments provided from a debugger restart (@pxenduserref{Error
Management}).

The conversion protocol is implemented through a @code{convert} generic
function for which you must provide a method.

@deffn {Generic Function} convert OPTION ARGUMENT
@gfsubindex{convert}
@ecindex invalid-argument
Convert @var{ARGUMENT} to @var{OPTION's} value. If @var{ARGUMENT} is
invalid, raise an @code{invalid-argument} error.
@end deffn

As you can see, you need to provide a method with the first argument
specialized to your new option type. This method must return the
conversion of @var{ARGUMENT} to the appropriate type if it is valid, and
raise an @code{invalid-argument} error otherwise.

@ecindex invalid-argument
The @code{invalid-argument} error condition is defined like this:

@cartouche
@verbatim
(define-condition invalid-argument (option-error)
  ((argument :documentation "The invalid argument."
	     :type string
	     :initarg :argument
	     :reader argument)
   (comment :documentation "An additional comment about the error."
	    :type string
	    :initarg :comment
	    :reader comment))
  (:report (lambda (error stream)
	     (format stream "Option ~A: invalid argument ~S.~@[~%~A~]"
	       (option error) (argument error) (comment error))))
  (:documentation "An invalid argument error."))
@end verbatim
@end cartouche

@ecindex invalid-argument
@ecsindex{invalid-argument,argument}
@ecsindex{invalid-argument,comment}
When the error is raised, you must fill in the @code{argument} and
@code{comment} slots appropriately.
@ecindex option-error
@ecsindex{option-error,option}
As before, the super-condition @code{option-error} provides an
additional @code{option} slot that you must also fill in when the error
is raised.

@gfmindex{convert,@r{Enumerations (}enum@r{)}}
Let's look at the enumeration example now.

@cartouche
@verbatim
(defmethod convert ((enum enum) argument)
  "Convert (possibly abbreviated) ARGUMENT to ENUM's value.
If ARGUMENT doesn't name one of ENUM's symbols, raise a conversion error."
  (or (closest-match argument (enum enum) :ignore-case t :key #'symbol-name)
      (error 'invalid-argument
	     :option enum
	     :argument argument
	     :comment (format nil "Valid arguments are: ~A."
			(symbols-to-string (enum enum))))))
@end verbatim
@end cartouche

@voindex{Enumerations,enum}
@vopindex{Enumerations,enum,:enum}
Since enumerations allow their arguments to be abbreviated, a utility
function is used to find the closest match between an argument and the
possible values. Otherwise, the @code{invalid-argument} error is raised.


@node Constructor Functions, , Conversion Protocol, New Option Types
@subsection Constructor Functions
@cindex Constructors, for options objects
@cindex Option Constructors
The last required step to complete our new option type extension is to
provide a @dfn{constructor} function that wraps around
@code{make-instance} on the corresponding option class. I won't insult
you by explaining how to write a constructor. Let me just give four good
reasons why providing constructors is important.

Providing a constructor for every new option type is important because:
@enumerate
@item
it is important,
@item
it is a good software engineering practice,
@item
it is important,
@item
@findex defsynopsis
@findex defgroup
and above all, it makes your new option type automatically available in
calls to @code{defsynopsis} and @code{defgroup} (@pxref{Synopsis Items}
and @ref{Group Definition}).
@end enumerate


@voindex{Enumerations,enum}
@cfindex{make-enum}
Let's look at the enumeration example now.

@cartouche
@verbatim
(defun make-enum (&rest keys
		  &key short-name long-name description
		       argument-name argument-type
		       enum env-var fallback-value default-value
		       nullablep hidden)
  "Make a new enum option.
- SHORT-NAME is the option's short name (without the dash).
  It defaults to nil.
- LONG-NAME is the option's long name (without the double-dash).
  It defaults to nil.
- DESCRIPTION is the option's description appearing in help strings.
  It defaults to nil.
- ARGUMENT-NAME is the option's argument name appearing in help strings.
- ARGUMENT-TYPE is one of :required, :mandatory or :optional (:required and
  :mandatory are synonyms).
  It defaults to :optional.
- ENUM is the set of possible values.
- ENV-VAR is the option's associated environment variable.
  It defaults to nil.
- FALLBACK-VALUE is the option's fallback value (for missing optional
  arguments), if any.
- DEFAULT-VALUE is the option's default value, if any.
- NULLABLEP indicates whether this option accepts nil as a value.
- When HIDDEN, the option doesn't appear in help strings."
  (declare (ignore short-name long-name description
		  argument-name argument-type
		  enum env-var fallback-value default-value
		  nullablep))
  (apply #'make-instance 'enum keys))
@end verbatim
@end cartouche

Woah, what a mouthful for a single line of code@dots{} Yeah, I'm a
maniac and I like redundancy. I always restate all the available keys
explicitely, and everything again in the docstring so that all the
interesting information is directly available (I might change my mind as
I grow older though).

types. Here is some piece of advice that you might find useful in the
process.

@end menu

@node Incremental Option Types, Lisp Option Abuse, Extension Tips, Extension Tips
@subsection Incremental Option Types
@findex defoption
@code{defoption} is a nice convenience macro for new (valued) option
types that you define ``from scratch'' (we have even seen a more
contrived example where an additional super-class is used). However, you
might not want to use it all the time. For example, if one of the
built-in options is almost what you need, you can perfectly subclass it
instead of using @code{defoption}, and only change what's needed, as
long as you follow the 3 other steps correctly. After all, it's Lisp.
Lisp is a world of mess@t{^D^D^D^D}freedom.

@node Lisp Option Abuse, , Incremental Option Types, Extension Tips
@subsection Lisp Option Abuse
@voindex{Lisp Objects,lispobj}
@vopindex{Lisp Objects,lispobj,:typespec}
Along with the same lines, you may find that the @code{lispobj} type is
all you need in many situations. Let's take an example. Suppose you want
to implement a @code{--stars} option to assign a rank to a movie, from 0
to 5. The lazy approach is to simply create a @code{lispobj} option with
a @code{:typespec} (type specifier) of @code{(integer 0 5)} and you're
done.

But now, remember that the end-user of your application is probably not
a Lisper (in fact, I would hope that @clon{} contributes to increasing
the number of standalone @cl{} applications out there@dots{}). What do
you think would be her reaction, if, after providing a bogus value to
the @code{--stars} option, she get the following error message:

@verbatim
 Option 'stars': invalid argument "6".
Argument "6" must evaluate to (integer 0 5).
@end verbatim

or worse, a @code{"Cannot parse argument"} error message because of a
typo?

Not very friendly, right? In other words, you need to think in terms of
what the end-user of your application will expect. In that particular
situation, you might want to subclass @code{lispobj} only to provide
friendlier error messages.

@node Using Different Synopsis, Using Different Command-Lines, Multiple Clon Instances, Multiple Clon Instances
@subsection Using Different Synopsis
@cindex Synopsis, default
Did you notice that after defining a synopsis, there is actually never
any explicit reference to it anymore? So where is the magick? In fact,
there's no magick at all involved here.

@vindex *default-synopsis*
@foindex{defsynopsis,:make-default}
@cfiaindex{make-synopsis,:make-default}
@clon{} has a global variable named @code{*default-synopsis*} which
holds the@dots{} default synopsis, yeah. When you define/create a
synopsis with either @code{defsynopsis} or @code{make-synopsis}, it is
automatically made the default one, unless you use the
@code{:make-default} option/initarg with a value of @code{nil}, like
this:

@verbatim
(defsynopsis (:make-default nil) ...)
@end verbatim

or this:

@verbatim
(make-synopsis :make-default nil ...)
@end verbatim

@cfindex{make-context}
When you create a context with @code{make-context}, the default synopsis
is used implicitely, but you have two ways to avoid this.

@enumerate
@item
@vindex *default-synopsis*
At any time in your program, you may change the value of
@code{*default-synopsis*}. All subsequent calls to @code{make-context}
will hence use this other synopsis.
@item
@cfiaindex{make-context,:synopsis}@c
If you prefer to use another synopsis only temporarily, you can use the
@code{:synopsis} initarg to @code{make-context} instead.
@end enumerate

@node Using Different Command-Lines, Using Multiple Contexts, Using Different Synopsis, Multiple Clon Instances
@subsection Using Different Command-Lines
In @ref{Context Creation}, we saw that a context object describes a
particular instance of your application, most notably depending on the
actual @cmdline{} the end-user provided. It turns out, however that the
@cmdline{} doesn't need to be the actual program's @cmdline{}, as the
user typed it. Any list of strings can act as a @cmdline{}.

@cfiaindex{make-context,:cmdline}
The function @code{make-context} has a @code{:cmdline} key that allows
you to provide any list of strings that will act as the @cmdline{}. Of
course, the default is to use the actual program's one.

@node Using Multiple Contexts, Potential Uses, Using Different Command-Lines, Multiple Clon Instances
@subsection Using Multiple Contexts
@cindex Context, current
Did you also notice that after creating a context, there is actually
never any explicit reference to it anymore? So again, where is the
magick? In fact, there's no magick at all involved here either.

@vindex *current-context*
@cfiaindex{make-context,:make-current}
@clon{} has a global variable named @code{*current-context*} which holds
the@dots{} current context, yeah. When you create a context with
@code{make-context}, it is automatically made current, unless you use
the @code{:make-current} initarg with a value of @code{nil}.

@cindex Runtime Phase
@findex getopt
@findex getopt-cmdline
@findex multiple-value-getopt-cmdline
@findex do-cmdline-options
@findex help
The whole runtime phase API of @clon{} uses a context implicitely. This
involves @code{getopt}, @code{getopt-cmdline},
@code{multiple-value-getopt-cmdline}, @code{do-cmdline-options} and
@code{help}. As a consequence, it is possible to use @clon{} with
multiple contexts at the same time. There are in fact two ways to
achieve this.

@enumerate
@item
@vindex *current-context*
At any time in your program, you may change the value of
@code{*current-context*}. All subsequent calls to the runtime phase API
will hence use this other context.
@item
@fkindex{getopt,:context}@c
@fkindex{getopt-cmdline,:context}@c
@fkindex{help,:context}@c
@foindex{multiple-value-getopt-cmdline,:context}@c
@foindex{do-cmdline-options,:context}@c
If you prefer to use another context only temporarily, you can use the
@code{context} key instead. The whole runtime phase API of @clon{}
understands it. For the functions @code{getopt}, @code{getopt-cmdline}
and @code{help}, it's just another key in addition to those we've
already seen. For the macros @code{multiple-value-getopt-cmdline} and
@code{do-cmdline-options}, the key must appear at the end of the first
(list) argument, like this:

@verbatim
(multiple-value-getopt-cmdline (option name value :context ctx) ...)
(do-cmdline-options (option name value :context ctx) ...)
@end verbatim
@end enumerate

@node Potential Uses, , Using Multiple Contexts, Multiple Clon Instances
@subsection Potential Uses
By combining @clon{}'s ability to use a virtual @cmdline{}, different
synopsis and multiple contexts, you can achieve very neat (read: totally
useless) things. For instance, you could write an application that takes
an option providing @cmdline{} arguments for an external program to be
forked. Some revision control systems do that for controlling external
@code{diff} programs for instance, so no big deal. The big deal is that
you can completely control the validity of the external program's
@cmdline{}, before it is forked, from your original one.

Here is another idea, again related to revision control systems. Some of
them feature a @cmdline{} syntax like the following:

@verbatim
prog [global options] command [command-specific options]
@end verbatim

@cindex Postfix
@cindex Command-Line Remainder
@cindex Remainder, of command-line
You can achieve this with @clon{} quite easily I think (untested).
First, define a synopsis which only handles the global options, and
provide a postfix of @code{"command [command-specific option]"} or
something. This will authorize a @cmdline{} remainder which will start
with the command name.

Now, for every command in your program, define a specific synopsis with
only the command-specific options. Get the remainder of the original
@cmdline{} (@pxref{Command-Line Remainder}) and figure out which command
was used. Depending on it, create a new context with the appropriate
synopsis and the original @cmdline{}'s remainder as the new, virtual,
@cmdline{}. You're done: retrieve global options from the first context,
and command-specific ones from the second one.

@cindex Help String, display
@findex help
@fkindex{help,:item}
@bioindex{search-path}
@evindex{CLON_SEARCH_PATH}
@bioindex{highlight}
@evindex{CLON_HIGHLIGHT}
@bioindex{theme}
@evindex{CLON_THEME}
@bioindex{line-width}
@evindex{CLON_LINE_WIDTH}
What is even cooler is that you can display the command-specific options
on demand quite easily as well (like what @file{git} does when you call
it like this: @code{git commit --help} for instance). Just call the
@code{help} function with the original context (in order to preserve the
end-user choices with respect to highlighting @etc{}), but use the
@code{:item} key and give it the command-specific synopsis as its value.



@c -------------------------
@c Programmatic Help Strings
@c -------------------------
@node Programmatic Help Strings, Version Numbering, Multiple Clon Instances, Advanced Usage
@section Programmatic Help Strings

@findex help
@cindex Help String
@cindex Themes
@cindex Themes, standard, @t{refcard}
@cindex Standard Themes, @t{refcard}
So far, we've seen how to use the @code{help} function to implement a
typical @code{--help} option. This is mostly intended for the end-user.
There are also times when this function could be useful to @emph{you},
the application developer. For instance, one could imagine that part of
the compilation phase would involve generating the help string in order
to include it in the manual. Another idea would be that @samp{make
install} creates a @file{REFCARD} file in
@file{/usr/local/share/doc/my-app/} which contains the help string
formatted with the @code{refcard} theme, @etc{}.

@bioindex{theme}
@evindex{CLON_THEME}
@bioindex{search-path}
@evindex{CLON_SEARCH_PATH}
@bioindex{line-width}
@evindex{CLON_LINE_WIDTH}
@bioindex{highlight}
@evindex{CLON_HIGHLIGHT}
In such situations, calling the @code{help} function might not be
directly associated with an end-user level option, or at least not
@code{--help}, and you might not want to honor the end-user level
settings for theme, search path, line-width, or highlighting either
(remember that these settings might come from the environment variables
associated with @option{--clon-theme}, @option{--clon-search-path},
@option{--clon-line-width} and @option{--clon-highlight}).

@fkindex{help,:theme}
@fkindex{help,:search-path}
@fkindex{help,:line-width}
@fkindex{help,:highlight}
Because of this, the @code{help} function provides additional keys that
allow you to override those settings (they are in fact stored in the
context object). The keys in question are: @code{:theme},
@code{:search-path}, @code{:line-width} and @code{:highlight}.

@fkindex{help,:output-stream}
@vindex *standard-output*
In addition to that, there is an @code{:output-stream} key which
defaults to @code{*standard-output*} which you could use for instance to
write directly to a file. Note that there is no end-user level access to
this parameter.



@c -----------------
@c Version Numbering
@c -----------------
@node Version Numbering, , Programmatic Help Strings, Advanced Usage
@section Version Numbering

@bioindex{version}
As @clon{} evolves over time, you might one day feel the need for
conditionalizing your code on the version of the library. While the
end-user of your application has limited means to access the current
version number of @clon{} (see @enduserref{Clonification} and the
built-in option @code{--clon-version}), you, the application programmer
and @clon{} user, have a finer grained access to it.

The first thing you can do to access the current version number of
@clon{} is use the @code{version} function (this is in fact the function
bound to the @code{--clon-version} option).

@defun version &optional (TYPE :number)
Return the current version number of @clon{}. @var{TYPE} can be one of
@code{:number}, @code{:short} or @code{:long}. For @code{:number}, the
returned value is a fixnum. Otherwise, it is a string.
@end defun

A @clon{} version is characterized by 4 elements as described below.
@itemize
@item
@vindex +release-major-level+
A major version number stored in the constant
@code{+release-major-level+}.
@item
@vindex +release-minor-level+
A minor version number, stored in the constant
@code{+release-minor-level+}.
@item
@vindex +release-status+
A release status stored in the constant @code{+release-status+}. The
status of a release can be @code{:alpha}, @code{:beta}, @code{:pre} or
@code{:patchlevel}. These are in effect 4 levels of expected stability,
@code{:pre} meaning pre-release and @code{:patchlevel} corresponding to
a stable version of the library.
@item
@vindex +release-status-level+
A status-specific version number stored in the constant
@code{+release-status-level+}. Status levels start at 1 for unstable
versions (@eg{} beta 1, beta 2 @etc{}), but start at 0 for stable
releases (@eg{} 2.4.0, 2.4.1 @etc{}).
@end itemize

@vindex +release-name+
In addition to that, each version of @clon{} (in the sense
@emph{major.minor}, regardless of the status) has a name, stored in teh
constant @code{+release-name+}. The chosen theme for the 1.x series is
``Great Jazz Sax Players''.

Here is how the @code{version} function computes its value.
@itemize
@item
A version @code{:number} is computed as @emph{major . 10000 + minor .
100 + patchlevel}, effectively leaving two digits for each level. Note
that alpha, beta and pre status are ignored in version numbers (this is
as if the corresponding status level was considered to be always 0).
Only stable releases have their level taken into account.
@item
A @code{:short} version will appear like this for unstable releases:
1.3a4, 2.5b8 or 4.2pre1. Remember that alpha, beta or pre levels start
at 1. Patchlevels for stable releases start at 0 but 0 is ignored in the
output. So for instance, version 4.3.2 will appear as-is, while version
1.3.0 will appear as just 1.3.
@item
A @code{:long} version is expanded from the short one, and includes the
release name. For instance, 1.3 alpha 4 "Bill Evans", 2.5 beta 8 "Scott
Henderson", 4.2 pre 1 "Herbie Hancock" or 4.3.2 "Chick Corea". As for
the short version, a patchlevel of 0 is ignored in the output: 1.3 "Bill
Evans".
