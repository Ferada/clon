@chapter Introduction

@clon{} is a library for managing @cmdline{} options in standalone @cl{}
applications. It provides a unified option syntax with both short and
long names, automatic completion of partial names and automatic
retrieval/conversion of option arguments from the @cmdline{}, associated
environment variables or default values. @clon{} comes with a set of
extensible option types (numbers, paths, strings @etc{}). @clon{} also
provides automatic generation and formatting of help strings, with
support for highlighting on @tty{}'s through ISO/IEC 6429 SGR. This
formatting is customizable through @emph{themes}.

Depending on the target audience, @clon{} stands for either ``The
@CmdLine{} Option Nuker'' or ``The @cl{} Option Nuker''. @clon{} also
has a recursive acronym: ``@clon{} Likes Options Nuking'', and a reverse
one: ``Never Omit to Link with @clon{}''. Other possible expansions of
the acronym are still being investigated.

This manual is for the @clon{} @emph{user}, that is, the developer of a
@cl{} application who wants to use @clon{} for @cmdline{} option
management@footnote{An application using @clon{} for its @cmdline{}
option management is said to be @emph{clonified}. It is also possible to
say @emph{clonfiscated}. However, we advise against using
@emph{clonistified}. The term @emph{clonificated} is also considered bad
style, and the use of @emph{clonificationated} is strictly prohibited.}.
As opposed to the user of the @emph{library}, the user of an
@emph{application} powered by @clon{} is called an @emph{end-user}.
@clon{} provides both a user manual (this one) and an end-user manual
(@pxref{Top, , , clon-end-user, The Clon End-User Manual, The Clon
End-User Manual}). Everybody should read the end-user manual first.
