@chapter Introduction

@Clon{} is a library for managing command-line options in standalone
Common Lisp applications. It provides a unified option syntax with both
short and long names, automatic completion of partial names and
automatic retrieval/conversion of option values from the command-line,
associated environment variables or default values. @Clon{} comes with a
set of extensible option types (numbers, paths, strings etc). @Clon{}
also provides automatic generation and formatting of help strings, with
support for highlighting on @tty{}'s through ISO/IEC 6429 SGR. This
formatting is customizable through ``themes''.

Depending on the target audience, @Clon{} stands for either ``The
Command-Line Option Nuker'' or ``The Common Lisp Option Nuker''. @Clon{}
also has a recursive acronym: ``@Clon{} Likes Options Nuking'', and a
reverse one: ``Never Omit to Link with @Clon{}''.

This manual is for the @Clon{} end-user, that is, the user of an
application powered by @Clon{}. It describes how to use the command-line
of clonified@footnote{An application using @Clon{} for its command-line
option management is said to be ``clonified''. It is also possible to
say ``clonfiscated''. However, we advise against using ``clonistified''. 
The term ``clonificated'' is also considered bad style, and the use of
``clonificationated'' is strictly prohibited.} applications and how to
customize @Clon{}'s output. Everybody should read this manual first. If
you want to use @Clon{} in one of your applications, then you are
considered a @Clon{} @emph{user}, as opposed to a @Clon{}
@emph{end-user}, and you should then read the corresponding manual
(@pxref{Top, , , clon-user, The Clon user manual, The Clon user manual}).

@chapter Clonification

Before knowing how to handle clonified programs, you must ensure that
they are indeed @Clon{}-enabled. Perhaps the simplest way to do that is
to type @kbd{theprogram --clon-help} and see what happens. If you get an
error, then you're out of luck. Otherwise, you will get a list of
@Clon{}-specific options. Every clonified application has these options
built-in. We will describe most of them when appropriate in this manual,
but here's already the description for a couple of them (in addition to
@option{--clon-help} that we've just mentioned).

@itemize @bullet
@item @option{--clon-banner}

This option outputs a whole bunch of information, including the version
of @Clon{} the application is using, and @Clon{}-specific copyright
information.

@item @option{--clon-version}

This option outputs the version of @Clon{} the application is using. By
default (or by using it like this: @kbd{--clon-version=long}), this
information is provided in ``long'' form (release number, status and
name; just try it to see what gives). If you ask for
@kbd{--clon-version=short}, you'll get a more compact version
information, and if you try @kbd{--clon-version=number}, you will end up
with a purely numerical version number. For more information on @Clon{}
version numbering, @xref{Version Numbering, , , clon-user, The Clon user
manual, The Clon user manual}.
