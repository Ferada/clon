* Installing Clon

Clon comes with the Common Lisp source code in the src directory and some data
in the share directory. Note that this data is not required in order to
/build/ a clonified application, but it is required in order to /run/ it.

** Installing the Lisp files
Since Clon is ASDF aware, installing it simply requires you to:
1. cd the-common-lisp-systems-directory
2. ln -s the-path-to-clon-sources/src/clon.asd

** Installing the shared data
Data files are installed in /usr/local/share by default.
1. Optionally edit Makefile.cnf to specify a different installation prefix.
2. Type "make install", either at the toplevel or in the share directory.
