* Anatomy of the tarball

The Clon distribution has the following shape:

./src/		;; source directory
./share/	;; data files
./doc/		;; documentation


* Building and Installation

** Edit Makefile.cnf
to modify some installation parameters (if needed).

** Type "make" and then "make install" from the toplevel directory
These targets (all targets actually) propagate to the subdiretories.

*** Additional notes:
The build phase generates the documentation (that's actually all it does). By
default, documentation is built (and installed) in info and PDF formats. If
you want other formats, type "make all-formats" in the doc directory. You can
also type individually make "dvi", "ps" and/or "html" in order to get the
corresponding format.


* Uninstallation

Type "make uninstall".
