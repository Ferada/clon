* Anatomy of the tarball

The Clon distribution has the following shape:

./src/		;; source directory
./share/	;; data files
./doc/		;; documentation


* Installation

** Edit Makefile.cnf
to modify some installation parameters (if needed).

** Type "make" and then "make install" from the toplevel directory
These targets (all targets actually) propagate to the subdiretories.
