* Anatomy of the tarball

The Clon distribution has the following shape:

./src/		;; source directory
./sbcl/	        ;; SBCL grovel module
./share/	;; data files
./doc/		;; documentation
./demos/        ;; demo programs

* Portability
Clon currently works with SBCL, CMUCL, CCL, ECL and CLISP.
Clon has no dependency, except with CLISP in which case CFFI is needed.


* Configuration
Edit Makefile.cnf to your specific needs. For ASDF 1, the demo programs
demos/simple.lisp and demos/advanced.lisp might also need some tweaking.


* Pre-installation

If you're using ASDF 1, you need to "make install-system" before anything else
in order to create the system file symlink where appropriate. Otherwise (ASDF
2), we assume that you have unpacked somewhere in the source registry.


* Build

Type "make" to compile the demo programs and the documentation (end-user and
user manuals). A side effect of this is to also compile the library for the
Lisp implementation you chose. By default, the documentation is built in info,
PDF and HTML formats. If you want other formats (DVI and PostScript are
available), type "make all-formats". You can also type individually "make dvi"
and/or "make ps" in order to get the corresponding format.

In addition to the end-user and user manuals, you can generate a reference
manual for Clon. In order to do that, you need to have Declt installed (see
http://www.lrde.epita.fr/~didier/software/lisp/misc.php#declt), and SBCL since
Declt is currently an SBCL-only library (this dependency is why the reference
manual is not built by default). SBCL need not be your preferred Lisp
implementation in Makefile.cnf, but you need to have it properly configured
there.

To generate the reference manual, type "make ref". As for the rest of the
documentation, "make ref" compiles the reference manual in info, PDF and HTML
formats. If you want other formats (DVI and PostScript are available), type
"make all-formats-ref". You can also individually type "make dvi-ref" and/or
"make ps-ref" in order to get the corresponding format only.


* Installation

Type "make install" to install both the documentation and the data files. If
you have compiled the documentation in DVI and PostScript format, those will
be installed as well. The same goes for the reference manual.

The demo programs are not installed anywhere.


* Uninstallation

Type "make uninstall".
