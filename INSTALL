* Anatomy of the tarball

The Clon distribution has the following shape:

./src/		;; source directory
./sbcl/	        ;; SBCL grovel module
./share/	;; data files
./doc/		;; documentation
./demo/         ;; demo program


* Configuration
You may need to edit Makefile.cnf, demo/demo.lisp and doc/generate.sh in order
to tweak some installation parameters.


* Building and installing

Typing "make" will compile the documentation (end-user and user manuals). By
default, the documentation is built in info, PDF and HTML formats. If you want
other formats (DVI and PostScript are available), type "make all-formats". You
can also type individually "make dvi" and/or "make ps" in order to get the
corresponding format.

Typing "make install" will install both the documentation and the data files. 
If you're using ASDF 1, you will want to "make install-system" in order to
create the system file symlink where appropriate.

If you want to compile the demo program, type "make demo". This program is not
installed anywhere.


* Building and installing the reference manual
In addition to the end-user and user manuals, you can generate a reference
manual for Clon. In order to do that, you need to have Declt installed (see
http://www.lrde.epita.fr/~didier/software/lisp/misc.php#declt).

If you're using ASDF 1, you need to have typed "make install-system" first
(that is why the reference manual is not built by default).

To generate the reference manual, type "make ref".
To install it, type "make install-ref".

As for the rest of the documentation, "make ref" compiles the reference manual
in info, PDF and HTML formats. If you want other formats (DVI and PostScript
are available), type "make all-formats-ref". You can also individually type
"make dvi-ref" and/or "make ps-ref" in order to get the corresponding format
only.

Incidentally, a web-specific version of the reference manual is generated
under the name webreference.texi (See *link-files* in the Declt library for an
explanation). You can also format this version by using the "make webref", or
just the 'pdf-webref' / 'html-webref' sub-targets.


* Uninstalling

Type "make uninstall".
