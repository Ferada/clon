Copying and distribution of this file, with or without modification,

* Anatomy of the tarball
The Clon distribution has the following shape:

./src/		;; source directory
./sbcl/	        ;; SBCL grovel module
./clisp/	;; cffi grovel module for CLISP
./share/	;; data files
./doc/		;; documentation
./demos/        ;; demo programs
./emacs/        ;; Emacs edition utilities


* Portability
Clon currently works on Unix systems (MacOS X included) with SBCL, CMUCL
(20b), CCL, ECL, CLISP and ABCL (0.24.0). Clon has no mandatory dependency. 
CFFI may optionally be used with CLISP. See section A.1 of the user manual for
more information.


* Configuration
Edit Makefile.cnf to your specific needs. For ASDF 1, the demo programs
demos/simple.lisp and demos/advanced.lisp might also need some tweaking.


* Pre-installation
If you're using ASDF 1, you need to "make install-system" before anything else
in order to create the system file symlink where appropriate. Otherwise (ASDF
2), we assume that you have unpacked somewhere in the source registry.


* Build
Type "make" to compile the demo programs and the documentation (end-user
manual, user manual and possibly reference manual). By default, the
documentation is built in info, PDF and HTML formats. If you want other
formats (DVI and PostScript are available), type "make all-formats". You can
also type individually "make dvi" and/or "make ps" in order to get the
corresponding format.

As documented in Makefile.cnf, the reference manual is only generated if you
have SBCL and the Declt library at hand (see
http://www.lrde.epita.fr/~didier/software/lisp/misc.php#declt).


* Installation
Type "make install" to install both the documentation and the data files. If
you have compiled the documentation in DVI and PostScript format, those will
be installed as well. The same goes for the reference manual.

The demo programs are not installed anywhere.


* Uninstallation
Type "make uninstall".
