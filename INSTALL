* Anatomy of the tarball

The Clon distribution has the following shape:

./src/		;; source directory
./sbcl/	        ;; SBCL grovel module
./share/	;; data files
./doc/		;; documentation
./demo/         ;; demo program


* Building

** Edit Makefile.cnf if needed
All make targets from the toplevel propagate to the subdirectories.

** Type "make" from the toplevel directory
The build phase generates the demo program and the documentation (end-user and
user manuals). By default, documentation is built in info, PDF and HTML
formats. If you want other formats (DVI and PostScript are available), type
"make all-formats" in the doc directory. You can also type individually "make
dvi" and/or "make ps" in order to get the corresponding format.


* Installing

** Type "make install" from the toplevel directory
This installs the ASDF system file, the data and the documentation. The demo
program is not installed anywhere.


* Reference Manual
In addition to the end-user and user manuals, you can generate a reference
manual for Clon. This, however, must be done after installation. This is why
the reference manual is not generated by default.

In order to generate the reference manual, you also need to have Declt
installed (see http://www.lrde.epita.fr/~didier/software/lisp/misc.php#declt).

Do the following:
cd doc/
make ref

As for the rest of the documentation, this compiles the reference manual in
info, PDF and HTML formats. If you want other formats (DVI and PostScript are
available), type "make all-formats-ref" in the doc/ directory. You can also
individually type "make dvi-ref" and/or "make ps-ref" in order to get the
corresponding format only.

To install the reference manual, type "make install-ref".

Incidentally, a web-specific version of the reference manual is generated
under the name webreference.texi (See *link-files* in the Declt library for an
explanation). You can also format this version by using the "make webref", or
just the 'pdf-webref' / 'html-webref' sub-targets.


* Uninstalling

Type "make uninstall".
