* Anatomy of the tarball

The Clon distribution has the following shape:

./src/		;; source directory
./sbcl/	        ;; SBCL grovel module
./share/	;; data files
./doc/		;; documentation
./demos/        ;; demo programs


* Configuration
Edit Makefile.cnf to your specific needs. For ASDF 1, the demo programs
demos/simple.lisp and demos/advanced.lisp might also need some tweaking.


* Building and installing

If you're using ASDF 1, you need to "make install-system" before anything else
in order to create the system file symlink where appropriate. Otherwise (ASDF
2), we assume that you have unpacked somewhere in the source registry.

Type "make" to compile the documentation (end-user and user manuals). By
default, the documentation is built in info, PDF and HTML formats. If you want
other formats (DVI and PostScript are available), type "make all-formats". You
can also type individually "make dvi" and/or "make ps" in order to get the
corresponding format.

Type "make install" to install both the documentation and the data files.

If you want to compile the demo programs, type "make demos". These programs
are not installed anywhere.


* Building and installing the reference manual
In addition to the end-user and user manuals, you can generate a reference
manual for Clon. In order to do that, you need to have Declt installed (see
http://www.lrde.epita.fr/~didier/software/lisp/misc.php#declt), and SBCL since
Declt is currently an SBCL-only library. This dependency is why the reference
manual is not built by default.

To generate the reference manual, type "make ref".
To install it, type "make install-ref".

As for the rest of the documentation, "make ref" compiles the reference manual
in info, PDF and HTML formats. If you want other formats (DVI and PostScript
are available), type "make all-formats-ref". You can also individually type
"make dvi-ref" and/or "make ps-ref" in order to get the corresponding format
only.

You may also generate a "web", unlinked version of the reference manual (see
the variable *link-files* for an explanation) by typing "make webref" or "make
pdf-webref" and "make html-webref" individually.


* Uninstalling

Type "make uninstall".
